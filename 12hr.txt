Python has a wide variety of built-in modules and third-party libraries that you can import and use for different tasks. Here are some commonly used built-in modules:

1. **math**: Provides mathematical functions.
   ```python
   import math
   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
   ```

2. **datetime**: Handles date and time operations.
   ```python
   from datetime import datetime
   now = datetime.now()
   print(now)  # Output: Current date and time
   ```

3. **os**: Interacts with the operating system, allows file and directory operations.
   ```python
   import os
   print(os.listdir('.'))  # List files in the current directory
   ```

4. **sys**: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
   ```python
   import sys
   print(sys.version)  # Output: Python version information
   ```

5. **random**: Generates random numbers and selections (as you've seen).
   ```python
   import random
   print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Random integer between 1 and 10
   ```

6. **json**: Parses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.
   ```python
   import json
   data = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
   parsed_data = json.loads(data)
   print(parsed_data['name'])  # Output: Alice
   ```

7. **requests**: (third-party) Makes HTTP requests to web services.
   ```python
   import requests
   response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
   print(response.json())  # Output: JSON response from the API
   ```

8. **re**: Handles regular expressions for pattern matching in strings.
   ```python
   import re
   pattern = r'\d+'
   result = re.findall(pattern, 'There are 2 apples and 5 oranges.')
   print(result)  # Output: ['2', '5']
   ```

9. **csv**: Reads and writes CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.
   ```python
   import csv
   with open('data.csv', mode='r') as file:
       reader = csv.reader(file)
       for row in reader:
           print(row)
   ```

10. **sqlite3**: Provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server.
    ```python
    import sqlite3
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    ```

These are just a few examples! Python's standard library is extensive, 
and there are countless third-party libraries available for various tasks.
If you have a specific task in mind, I can help suggest a module or library for that!
